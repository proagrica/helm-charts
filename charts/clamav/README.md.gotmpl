[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

## Installing the Chart

Before you can install the chart you will need to add the `proagrica` repo to [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

```shell
helm repo add proagrica https://proagrica.github.io/helm-charts/
```

After you've installed the repo you can install the chart.

```shell
helm upgrade --install --namespace default --values ./my-values.yaml my-release proagrica/{{ template "chart.name" . }}
```

## Freshclam

The tool `freshclam` is used to download and update ClamAVâ€™s official virus signature databases.

By default it is turned on (`freshclam.enabled` = `true`), this will use the image which doesn't include the signature databases (`clamav/clamav:{{ template "chart.appVersion" . }}_base`), will create an init container to do initial download, and secondary container to keep them up to date.

If freshclam is disabled (`freshclam.enabled` = `false`), this will use the image with signature databases included (`clamav/clamav:{{ template "chart.appVersion" . }}`) and no up dates will be made. This isn't recommended in production and provided for testing purposes. When using this the `databaseDirectory` should be set to `/var/lib/clamav`.
